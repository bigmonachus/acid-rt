## Real time ray tracing library for Virtual Reality.

I'm writing a game, and I decided to make the guts open source. 

## Features / Requirements:

* Not for general consumption at the moment :)
* (Only) Supports DK2 on Windows.
* OpenGL 4.3 required
* Written in modern C, with some features taken from C++
    - namespaces, polymorphism, templates for generics when absolutely needed.
* golang-like standard library
    - Garbage collected slices
    - Also inspired by Haskell's type classes

## Planned:

* Loader for animated meshes
* Integration with some sound library
* Computer art (fractal 3D structures and a synth)
