You are a point.
You can't see yourself, but you can move around.

In this universe, space is compressed.

Some things are less compressed than others. You can tell them apart very easily.
They look weird; oddly transparent. Beware! If you touch them, you will go inside.

Once you enter, you will leave a shining portal, through which you can go outside.
